# Summary for Revision 1#

Summary of revised version of model (sportsleague_rev1.mwb). This model supports an application that helps the league staff (manager, owner, whatever) to schedule games, and allows players/teams to sign up for leagues/teams.  

1) Teams and players. Statistics of teams and players can be tracked on a per-game basis.  
2) Leagues (a league is basically a season...we can rename this). 
3) Scheduling and playing regular season games. 
4) Locations for gameplay. Locations are defined by an address and the equipment they have available (so the league knows what they should bring, etc.). The addition of the equipment tables was just to increase the number of tables. 
5) Staff for refereeing games. Like the equipment tables, these were added just to increase the number of available tables.

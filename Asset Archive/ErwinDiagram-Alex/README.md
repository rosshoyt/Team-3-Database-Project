# Summary for Revision 1#

Summary of revised version of model (sportsleague_rev1.mwb). This model supports an application that helps the league staff (manager, owner, whatever) to schedule games, and allows players/teams to sign up for leagues/teams.  

1) Teams and players. Statistics of teams and players can be tracked on a per-game basis (the statistics attributes have not been placed in the proper tables yet, but they will be).  
2) Leagues (a league is basically a season...we can rename this). 
3) Scheduling and playing regular season games (playoffs not modeled).  
4) Facilities for gameplay. Facilitlies are defined by an address, the number of courts available, and the equipment they have available (so the league knows what they will have to bring, etc.). The addition of the equipment tables was just to increase the number of tables.
5) Staff for refereeing games. Like the equipment tables, these were added just to increase the number of available tables, but nonetheless cover an important aspect of scheduling games (making sure a ref is present to facilitate).

# Team-3-Database-Project
## FA2018 Database Systems_SeattleU_CPSC_5021_01 (Group 3 (Insert 'Official' Team Name Here Once Decided))
### Amateur Sports League - Database Program
####
##### Application Capabilities (General Ideas From Group Discussion and Emails, and with newly added prompts about key aspects of the app)
1. App used to keep track of an amateur sports leage
2. End User should be able to add individual sports teams to the database, and do all other database operations neccessarry in whatever
functionality we want our application to provide to user.
3. How to Keep track of game statistics during 'season'?
4. Player stats?
5. Sport Type? 

##### User Interface/Experience Ideas
1. How flexible should the app be in allowing the user to configure their sport(s) league?
-Allow user to specify different choices of sport when setting up their league? (say Soccer and/or Basketball)?
  /*Initially, may be best to pick a specific sport (Basketball would be my vote) instead of leaving that 'up to user'. However,
  I think it's interesting to consider a global format that could take in any type of sport's associated requirements when setting up the 
  custom league...*/

##### Important data we might want to store
Allow user to specify a custom sport with custom league parameters? Or pick one sport and model the statistical data points being tracked
Number of games per season?
Should Application user be able to add sports team in the middle of 'season'?
What different ways and formats do we want to display the database system information to give different types of insights?

Should the intial sports league the user creates be re-usable for more than 1 season? 
Retain stats from past seasons?
Etc...

### Amateur Sports League - Database Program
####
##### Application Capabilities (General Ideas From Group Discussion and Emails, and with newly added prompts about key aspects of the app)
1. App used to keep track of an amateur sports leage
2. End User should be able to add individual sports teams to the database, and do all other database operations neccessarry in whatever
functionality we want our application to provide to user.
3. What team statistics should app track during season?
4. Also some player in-game stats?
5. How specific is the app to a specific sport, or is it a more general league tracking service?

##### User Interface/User Experience Ideas 
1. How flexible should the app be in allowing the user to configure their sport(s) league?
-Allow user to specify different choices of sport when setting up their league? (say Soccer and/or Basketball)?
  *May be best initially to pick a specific sport (Basketball would be my vote) instead of leaving that 'up to user'. However,
  I think it's interesting to consider a global format that could take in any type of sport's associated requirements when setting up the 
  custom league...*
2.  When creating league allow user to specify a custom sport with custom league parameters? Or pick one sport and have a more 
high-quality product built around the mechanics needed for a league of that type?

3. Should Application user be able to add sports team in the middle of 'season'?

4. Should the intial sports league the user creates be re-usable for more than 1 season? 

##### Important league data we want to store
Number of games per season
Number of players per team

[fill in more examples]

What different ways and formats do we want to display the database system information to give different types of insights?

####
Retain stats from past seasons?
Etc...
